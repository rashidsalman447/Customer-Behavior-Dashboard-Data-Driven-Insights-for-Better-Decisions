# Customer-Behavior-Dashboard-Data-Driven-Insights-for-Better-Decisions
📊 Customer Behavior Analysis Project
✅ Overview

This project showcases a complete end-to-end data analytics workflow — from loading raw data in Python to building a fully interactive Power BI dashboard and presenting insights in a structured report and presentation.
The goal is to analyze customer purchasing behavior, identify key patterns, and deliver insights that support business decision-making.

📁 Dataset

The dataset includes customer information such as:

Demographics (age group, gender)

Purchase history (amount, category, shipping type)

Review ratings

Subscription status

Sales and revenue details

The raw dataset is loaded and explored using Python before being stored and queried in PostgreSQL.

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn)

PostgreSQL (SQL queries, relational storage)

Power BI (interactive dashboard creation)

Gamma App (to design the presentation deck)

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

Excel/CSV dataset
